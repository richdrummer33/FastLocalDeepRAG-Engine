Do your research. \n\nfrom llama_index import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader, ServiceContext\nfrom llama_index.llms import HuggingFaceLLM\n\ndocuments = SimpleDirectoryReader(\"data\").load_data()\nChatGPT\nFinished browsing\nThe SimpleDirectoryReader in LlamaIndex is primarily designed to read data from a specified directory or a list of files but does not natively support recursive loading of files from subdirectories\u200b1\u200b. A Github issue suggests the idea of adding a recursive parameter to the SimpleDirectoryReader to enable recursive loading, but it's not clear if this feature was ever implemented\u200b2\u200b.\n\nAn article on betterprogramming.pub mentions combining index nodes for recursive retrieval and document agents in LlamaIndex, but this is in a different context and doesn't seem to directly relate to SimpleDirectoryReader\u200b3\u200b.\n\nAdditionally, there's a mention of executing queries recursively in the context of Composability in LlamaIndex, but again, this does not directly pertain to SimpleDirectoryReader\u200b4\u200b.\n\nTo achieve recursive file loading with SimpleDirectoryReader, you might need to implement your own custom logic. For example, you could create a wrapper function that utilizes SimpleDirectoryReader to load data from a directory, then iteratively calls itself on any subdirectories within that directory. This way, you would effectively create a recursive directory reading process. Here's a rough example in Python to illustrate the concept:\n\npython\nCopy code\nfrom llama_index import SimpleDirectoryReader\nimport os\n\ndef recursive_directory_reader(directory):\n    documents = SimpleDirectoryReader(directory).load_data()\n    \n    # Get a list of subdirectories\n    subdirectories = [d for d in os.listdir(directory) if os.path.isdir(os.path.join(directory, d))]\n    \n    for subdirectory in subdirectories:\n        subdirectory_path = os.path.join(directory, subdirectory)\n        documents.extend(recursive_directory_reader(subdirectory_path))\n    \n    return documents\n\n# Usage:\ndocuments = recursive_directory_reader(\"data\")\nIn this example, recursive_directory_reader is a function that first calls SimpleDirectoryReader to load documents from the specified directory. It then obtains a list of subdirectories within that directory, and iteratively calls itself on each subdirectory to load documents from those as well. The loaded documents are collected into a single list, which is returned.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d0bf11f-b6e1-4ff5-b223-d6da10028726": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d0bf11f-b6e1-4ff5-b223-d6da10028726", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\richd\\Desktop\\test-rag\\testies.txt", "creation_date": "2023-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-02", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dffe920b-b3cc-4cb7-803c-076af7de956f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\richd\\Desktop\\test-rag\\testies.txt", "creation_date": "2023-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-02", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-03"}, "hash": "cf980f470585b8b73e2dc1d90c633c3a0196eb06426c5026b6ab0ab2e202b128"}, "2": {"node_id": "8ac1a2f2-7e1c-4995-b501-087baeb4d605", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\richd\\Desktop\\test-rag\\testies.txt", "creation_date": "2023-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-02", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-03"}, "hash": "21d467dae39030094142cbb35293d1adb6fb94e53ea86f087ecc2e6c4e9cb17f"}, "3": {"node_id": "536024cc-e276-4216-829a-58c657f2d521", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\richd\\Desktop\\test-rag\\testies.txt", "creation_date": "2023-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-02", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-03"}, "hash": "f36475f98545fbcf376780dee928c7ffadc1d8df6ab2ffa305e46e1ddf88177d"}}, "hash": "c4523b0b8d35ab92f229c05a93797ef1c34ce1b6901a17cbfe364c39767bc46e", "text": "User\npip install --upgrade huggingface_hub\nRequirement already satisfied: huggingface_hub in c:\\users\\richd\\.conda\\envs\\open-source-llm\\lib\\site-packages (0.17.3)\nCollecting huggingface_hub\n  Obtaining dependency information for huggingface_hub from https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ef/b5/b6107bd65fa4c96fdf00e4733e2fe5729bb9e5e09997f63074bb43d3ab28/huggingface_hub-0.18.0-py3-none-any.whl.metadata\n  Using cached huggingface_hub-0.18.0-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (13 kB)\nRequirement already satisfied: filelock in c:\\users\\richd\\appdata\\roaming\\python\\python39\\site-packages (from huggingface_hub) (3.12.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: fsspec>=2023.5.0 in c:\\users\\richd\\.conda\\envs\\open-source-llm\\lib\\site-packages (from huggingface_hub) (2023.6.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: requests in c:\\users\\richd\\appdata\\roaming\\python\\python39\\site-packages (from huggingface_hub) (2.31.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: tqdm>=4.42.1 in c:\\users\\richd\\appdata\\roaming\\python\\python39\\site-packages (from huggingface_hub) (4.66.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: pyyaml>=5.1 in c:\\users\\richd\\appdata\\roaming\\python\\python39\\site-packages (from huggingface_hub) (6.0.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: typing-extensions>=3.7.4.3 in c:\\users\\richd\\appdata\\roaming\\python\\python39\\site-packages (from huggingface_hub) (4.8.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: packaging>=20.9 in c:\\users\\richd\\appdata\\roaming\\python\\python39\\site-packages (from huggingface_hub) (23.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: colorama in c:\\users\\richd\\appdata\\roaming\\python\\python39\\site-packages (from tqdm>=4.42.1->huggingface_hub) (0.4.6)\nRequirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in c:\\users\\richd\\appdata\\roaming\\python\\python39\\site-packages (from requests->huggingface_hub) (3.3.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in c:\\users\\richd\\appdata\\roaming\\python\\python39\\site-packages (from requests->huggingface_hub) (3.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in c:\\users\\richd\\appdata\\roaming\\python\\python39\\site-packages (from requests->huggingface_hub) (2.0.6)\nRequirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in c:\\users\\richd\\appdata\\roaming\\python\\python39\\site-packages (from requests->huggingface_hub) (2023.7.22)\nUsing cached huggingface_hub-0.18.0-py3-none-any.whl (301 kB)\nInstalling collected packages: huggingface_hub\n  Attempting uninstall: huggingface_hub\n    Found existing installation: huggingface-hub 0.17.3\n    Uninstalling huggingface-hub-0.17.3:\n      Successfully uninstalled huggingface-hub-0.17.3\nERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed.

The tokenizers library requires a version of huggingface_hub that is less than 0.18 but greater or equal to 0.16.4. However, you have just upgraded huggingface_hub to version 0.18.0, which is incompatible with the current version of tokenizers you have installed.\n\nHere are a couple of steps you could take to resolve this:\n\nDowngrade huggingface_hub:\nDowngrade huggingface_hub to a compatible version, for instance 0.17.3, to maintain compatibility with the tokenizers library:\n\nbash\nCopy code\npip install huggingface_hub==0.17.3\nCheck for an updated tokenizers version:\nThere might be a newer version of the tokenizers library that supports huggingface_hub 0.18.0. You can check for and install the latest version of tokenizers with the following command:\n\nbash\nCopy code\npip install --upgrade tokenizers\nCheck Dependency Updates:\nSometimes library maintainers release new versions to address compatibility issues. It's always a good practice to keep an eye on the release notes or GitHub repositories of the libraries you are using for any updates regarding dependency compatibility.\n\nVirtual Environments:\nIf possible, consider working within a virtual environment to manage dependencies for your project. This way, you can have isolated environments with different versions of libraries, which can help avoid such conflicts.\n\nDependency Management Tools:\nUtilize dependency management tools like pipenv or poetry which can help resolve and manage dependency versions in a more sophisticated manner compared to pip alone.\n\nIn this case, downgrading huggingface_hub or upgrading tokenizers (if a compatible version is available) are likely the quickest solutions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8354440-967c-4c8b-ab02-857c72e3de6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8354440-967c-4c8b-ab02-857c72e3de6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\richd\\Desktop\\test-rag\\testies.txt", "creation_date": "2023-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-02", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dffe920b-b3cc-4cb7-803c-076af7de956f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\richd\\Desktop\\test-rag\\testies.txt", "creation_date": "2023-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-02", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-03"}, "hash": "cf980f470585b8b73e2dc1d90c633c3a0196eb06426c5026b6ab0ab2e202b128"}, "2": {"node_id": "536024cc-e276-4216-829a-58c657f2d521", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\richd\\Desktop\\test-rag\\testies.txt", "creation_date": "2023-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-02", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-03"}, "hash": "f36475f98545fbcf376780dee928c7ffadc1d8df6ab2ffa305e46e1ddf88177d"}}, "hash": "6fb58c1181c2c4a48fe5df1c00aee9b1b938a174fd600a34d942e687dd86640c", "text": "User\nllm = HuggingFaceLLM(). Is this compatible with gguf models? Check out huggingface docs\nChatGPT\nFinished browsing\nThe HuggingFaceLLM class from LlamaIndex does not have explicit documentation available regarding compatibility with GGUF models. However, there are various pieces of information from different sources that might help in understanding the potential compatibility or the steps that could be taken to work with GGUF models using HuggingFace tools or libraries.\n\nGGUF Model Format:\nGGUF is a new model format introduced by the llama.cpp team on August 21, 2023, as a replacement for the older GGML format. It's designed to be extensible and future-proof, providing better tokenization and support for special tokens among other benefits\u200b1\u200b\u200b2\u200b\u200b3\u200b.\n\nConversion of HuggingFace Models to GGUF Format:\nThere's information about converting HuggingFace models to GGUF format, indicating that there's a pathway for working with GGUF models starting from a HuggingFace model. A blog post on substratus.ai provides a guide on how to convert HuggingFace models to the GGUF format, mentioning a variety of models compatible with Llama.cpp, which supports GGUF models\u200b4\u200b. Additionally, there's a GitHub tutorial that provides a script for converting HuggingFace models to GGUF format, indicating that such conversions are possible\u200b5\u200b.\n\nRunning GGUF Models with Hugging Face Tools:\nA post on markhneedham.com mentions running GGUF models locally using a tool called Ollama, indicating that Hugging Face has tools or libraries that can interact with GGUF models. It mentions using the Hugging Face Hub CLI to download and work with GGUF models, suggesting that there's infrastructure within the Hugging Face ecosystem to handle GGUF models\u200b6\u200b.\n\nHuggingFaceLLM in LlamaIndex:\nThe HuggingFaceLLM class in LlamaIndex is mentioned in the documentation, though it doesn't provide explicit details regarding GGUF model compatibility. It's unclear if this class natively supports GGUF models or if there's a straightforward method to load GGUF models using HuggingFaceLLM\u200b7\u200b.\n\nGiven the lack of direct documentation regarding HuggingFaceLLM and GGUF model compatibility, and considering the available conversion tools and scripts for HuggingFace models to GGUF format, it's plausible that a conversion process might be necessary to work with GGUF models using HuggingFaceLLM. If HuggingFaceLLM does not natively support GGUF models, converting GGUF models to a format compatible with HuggingFace libraries, or using additional tools or scripts to load and work with GGUF models, might be the way to go.\n\nIt might also be beneficial to reach out to the developers or community forums related to LlamaIndex or Hugging Face for more precise information or guidance on this matter.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"c6a50701-5eda-4aa7-9ded-59c340d304b0": {"node_ids": ["778d0b26-9356-49ab-b43d-bbf34c26f8b3", "1b6fbfe0-dbad-4cfa-986d-a8050b9f176a", "c8e573b3-2c57-43b1-aa4c-ca0769f8a49f", "230b082f-e6e4-4967-be26-02624ebf6ee5", "621e268f-546d-4f93-a996-78876b083e97", "ec1a4c8f-97a4-4e3a-b1ef-6436f27e3c17", "cedd73a4-9ac2-4606-9aba-53d3e57b5b00", "503348ef-6660-4aa7-a01b-bbdda70237f4"], "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\richd\\Desktop\\test-rag\\2\\wurk.txt", "creation_date": "2023-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-02", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-03"}}, "dffe920b-b3cc-4cb7-803c-076af7de956f": {"node_ids": ["8ac1a2f2-7e1c-4995-b501-087baeb4d605", "5d0bf11f-b6e1-4ff5-b223-d6da10028726", "536024cc-e276-4216-829a-58c657f2d521", "a8354440-967c-4c8b-ab02-857c72e3de6f"], "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\richd\\Desktop\\test-rag\\testies.txt", "creation_date": "2023-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-02", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-03"}}}}
